## About 
A machine learning object that provides a set of supervised machine learning algorithms for gesture-sound interaction design. By implementing multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks (ANN), it allows to train linear regression and k-nearest neighbour classification models between multiple dimensions of input and target output. 

## Installation

If you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installed, you can install via Terminal using the following commands:

	cd ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Packages
	git clone https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/rapidmax

If not, you can [download the latest release here](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/rapidmax). After decompressing the zip archive, the resulting folder must be placed in the max search path, preferably in the following folder:

* `~/Documents/Max\ 8/Packages`
