# rapidmax

This is the [RapidLib](http://gitlab.doc.gold.ac.uk/rapid-mix/RapidLib/) C++ machine learning library wrapped into a max object:

## About 
A machine learning object for gesture-sound interaction design. It provides a set of supervised machine learning algorithms that implement multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks, allowing to train linear regression and k-nearerst neighbour classification models between multiple dimensions of input and target output, and predict new output values based on new input data. 

## Installation

If you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installed, you can clone this repo via Terminal using the following commands:

	cd ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Packages
	git clone https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/rapidmax

If not, you can [download the latest release here](https://github.com/francesco-di-maggio/rapidmax). After decompressing the zip archive, the resulting folder must be placed in the max search path, preferably in the following path:

* `~/Documents/Max\ 8/Packages`

## How it works

Open the help file (rapidmax/help/rapidmax.maxhelp) for how to use the object.

## Acknowledgments
This object is one outcome of the RapidMix project, which received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement N°644862.
