# rapidmax

A machine learning object that provides a set of supervised machine learning algorithms for gesture-sound interaction design. By implementing multiperceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks (ANN), it allows the training of linear regression and k-nearest neighbor classification models between multiple dimensions of input and target output. 

See rapidmax.maxhelp for how to use the object, just drag the rapidmax.mxo into the help folder, quit and reopen max for the helpfile.

## Installation
Download the .zip file. Copy the rapidmax folder in your max "packages" folder, quit and reopen max.

## How to
