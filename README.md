## About 
A machine learning object for gesture-sound interaction design. It provides a set of supervised machine learning algorithms that implement multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks, allowing to train linear regression and k-nearerst neighbour classification models between multiple dimensions of input and target output, and predict new output values based on new input data.
